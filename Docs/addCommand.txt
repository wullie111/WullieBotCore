this document will guide you through adding a command to wulliebotCore in a simmiler manner to the original code.
it is recomended you have some understanding of python before you start.

when adding a new command know whether the command needs a suffix to make sence, e.g "%report" for full effect the user should be able to add a name after. for cases like these use an if statment as it ensures a suffix will not brake the command.
if the command dosent need a suffix, e.g "%help" a match case should be used.
if the command requiers a certen user then a match case fallowed by an if statemnt to detect thec command should be used.
if the bot requiers a loop it is recomended to put them in a 'async task', when creating one fallow as close to the prexisting ones to ensure these work proparly, when creating the function give it an approprite name describing what it dose.

when adding a command to the core bot pleases use the perdefined heading noted in the comments of the main file.
if you are adding commands to a sub-bot that doesn't have these predefined heading then add your own fallowing the sturcture of the main ones.
